    "[V. Mnih et al., \"Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning.\" Nature, 518\n",

    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is known to be unstable or even to diverge when a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network is used to represent the action-value (also known as $Q$) function. This instability has several causes: the correlations present in the sequence of observations, the fact that small updates to $Q$ may significantly change the policy and therefore change the data distribution, and the correlations between the action-values ($Q$) and the target values $r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors suggest two key ideas to address these instabilities with a novel variant of Q-learning: Replay buffer and Fixed Q-target.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniformly random sampling from Experience Replay Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning agent stores the experiences consecutively in the buffer, so adjacent ($s, a, r, s'$) transitions stored are highly likely to have correlation. To remove this, the agent samples experiences uniformly at random from the pool of stored samples $\\big( (s, a, r, s') \\sim U(D) \\big)$. See sample_batch method of ReplayBuffer class for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixed Q-target\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN uses an iterative update that adjusts the action-values ($Q$) towards target values that are only periodically updated, thereby reducing correlations with the target; if not, it is easily divergy because the target continuously moves. The Q-learning update at iteration $i$ uses the following loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_i(\\theta_i) = \\mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \\sim U(D)} \\big[ \\big( r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a';\\theta_i^-) - Q(s, a; \\theta_i) \\big)^2 \\big]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in which $\\gamma$ is the discount factor determining the agent’s horizon, $\\theta_i$ are the parameters of the Q-network at iteration $i$ and $\\theta_i^-$ are the network parameters used to compute the target at iteration $i$. The target network parameters $\\theta_i^-$ are only updated with the Q-network parameters ($\\theta_i$) every C steps and are held fixed between individual updates. ($C = 200$ in CartPole-v0)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For more stability: Gradient clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors also found it helpful to clip the error term from the update $r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \\theta_i^-) - Q(s,a,;\\theta_i)$ to be between -1 and 1. Because the absolute value loss function $|x|$ has a derivative of -1 for all negative values of x and a derivative of 1 for all positive values of x, clipping the squared error to be between -1 and 1 corresponds to using an absolute value loss function for errors outside of the (-1,1) interval. This form of error clipping further improved the stability of the algorithm."

    "## Replay buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, people implement replay buffers with one of the following three data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - collections.deque\n",
    "  - list\n",
    "  - numpy.ndarray\n",
    "  \n",
    "**deque** is very easy to handle once you initialize its maximum length (e.g. deque(maxlen=buffer_size)). However, the indexing operation of deque gets terribly slow as it grows up because it is [internally doubly linked list](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity#collections.deque). On the other hands, **list** is an array, so it is relatively faster than deque when you sample batches at every step. Its amortized cost of  *Get item* is [O(1)](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity#list).\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, let's see **numpy.ndarray**. numpy.ndarray is even faster than list due to the fact that it is [a homogeneous array of fixed-size items](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray), so you can get the benefits of [locality of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference). Whereas list is an array of pointers to objects, even when all of them are of the same type.\n",
